In my opinion, one of the main strengths of Ember is that its strong opinions on directory structure and code organization makes it quite easy to open up any open source project and easily locate where certain business logic resides. While first learning Ember, I found myself looking at other open-source Ember projects in order to get a better understanding of how it works. Of course, you can take a look at EmberJS projects in the wild at [Built with Ember](http://builtwithember.io), but for studying purposes, let's take a look at popular open source EmberJS projects.

**[Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/)**  
Created by [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/), Discourse is a platform for community discussion, using a Ruby on Rails back-end.

**[Hummingbird](http://hummingbird.me)**  
I'm a fan of this one, given that I'm a fan of anime. Hummingbird is an anime discovery platform built with a Rails back-end, I found myself referencing this repo for an idea of how authentication works.
