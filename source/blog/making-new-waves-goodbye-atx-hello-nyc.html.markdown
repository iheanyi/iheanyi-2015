description: Saying goodbye to Austin, Texas and moving to the Big Apple for the
next chapter!
---

A year ago, I started working at IBM Watson on the Watson Life team. I've had the privilege of working on innovative projects such as [IBM Chef Watson](http://ibmchefwatson.com) and others in the works. While I've had a year filled with personal growth and learning the ins and outs of a large corporation, the time has come for the next chapter in my career. In March, I will be moving to New York City to work at [DigitalOcean](http://digitalocean.com) on the Community Engineering team. I'm going to answer some of the questions I've been frequently asked below.

##### Why DigitalOcean?  

I mean, have you seen their product? It's bloody gorgeous. I've been a
DigitalOcean customer for almost 3 years now and they've done nothing but
constantly improve the product. When recruiters and individuals from other
companies started reaching out to me, I made a promise to myself that I would
only work for a company in which I was personally invested as a frequent
customer OR one that had a mission that resonated greatly with me. DigitalOcean
definitely fit this bill in both regards. I truly believe that the more you're
personally invested in your company, the better your work will be.

##### What are you going to miss most about Austin?  

Well, besides no state income tax, mostly always warm and sunny weather, and
cheap cost of living, I am definitely going to miss the BBQ here, in addition to
breakfast tacos and Torchy's. Do they have breakfast tacos in New York City?

##### Do you plan on moving back to Austin?  

Perhaps, I just know that I can't buy a house in New York City unless I win the
lottery, so I'm gonna have to move somewhere where I can. If Austin fits that
bill, then perhaps I'll move back. We'll see. :P

##### What borough/neighborhood are you going to live in?  
I'm going to be living in Chinatown and SoHo for a couple of months, before
moving to Brooklyn. I haven't figured out which neighborhood in Brooklyn yet,
but so far Bed-Stuy and Flatbush are on the radar. If you have any other
recommendations for neighborhoods, let me know!

##### Are you starting your new job immediately?  
Not really. My last day at IBM Watson is February 26, and while I'll be moving
to New York City March 1st, I'm going to travel for a bit and start at
DigitalOcean mid-March. I truly believe it is always good to mentally reset/recharge before
starting a new adventure.

. . . 

I want to get a special changes to the people who I've met in Austin over the
last year in Austin who have made my time in this city so damn amazing. I am
really going to miss all of you and I hope that you will come and see me in the
Big Apple! Thanks everybody for your support and I'm excited for this next
chapter in my life. For those of you in New York City, hit me up and let's hang
out. I'm definitely looking for new friends.
