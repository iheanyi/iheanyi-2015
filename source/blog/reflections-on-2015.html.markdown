Not going to lie, writing this blog post feels very foreign to me, considering
it has been a few months since publishing my last blog post. That said, 2015 has
been a pretty good year nonetheless and I think it is always good for one to
reflect on their past year and see where they grew, where they fell short, and start thinking about changes for the next year. So let's get this started.

### Year in Review

Let's take a look back and see some of the major events of 2015 and takeaways
from them.

#### Facebook Page Unliker reaches #1 on ProductHunt  
  
The first major milestone I had was having one of my weekend side
projects, [Facebook Page Unliker](http://pageunliker.com), reach #1 on
[ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/facebook-page-unliker). I wrote a
[Medium post](https://medium.com/@kwuchu/lessons-learned-from-hacker-news-and-product-hunt-2134266bbab8#.j059vfqul) on the lessons learned from this achievement, but long story short, I realized that even if an application itself is not polished, people will still use it and enjoy it if it solves a real problem.

#### Moved to Austin, Texas and started my first job 

In February, I relocated to Austin and started working at IBM Watson. The most
challenging part of moving to a new city for me is the social aspect. In the
Watson Life team in Austin, I'm the youngest person on the team. The huge age
difference between my coworkers and I made hanging with coworkers outside of
worker kind of difficult. Luckily, I was able to meet people at local meetups,
so if you move to a new city, do not hesitate to use [Meetup](http://meetup.com)! 

#### Helped Launch Chef Watson
In the workplace, I was part of the team that helped take [Chef Watson](https://www.ibmchefwatson.com) out of beta and into GA as a full-stack developer. Working on Chef Watson gave me an idea of how to work on a team and also helped improve my communication skills since the majority of the team is distributed remotely. I have since moved onto a new project, but I have to say that working on Chef Watson was a blast.

#### Spoke at the FrontPorch and ThunderPlains Conferences!
Talk about the speaking experiences.

#### Launched [Two Black Nerds](http://twoblacknerds.com)
Write about Two Black Nerds here and the experience around it, getting
interviewed, etc.

#### Some other secret things ;D
I will say that some awesome things are coming in 2016 and I cannot wait to
share them with you!

### Lessons Learned

From these experiences and others, I want to share the lessons I've learned in
the past year.

#### Your voice matters.
Two Black Nerds has taught me the importance of visibility from people from
underrepresented groups in 
#### It's better to communicate more than less.

#### Work-Life balance is important
Seriously, you may want to be the all-star employee that works 60 hours a
week and is hyper-productive, but at the same time, it really is hard to keep
that up forever without burning out.

#### It's okay to relax.

#### Don't forget your hobbies.

#### Put yourself out there.

#### Never stop growing and learning.

#### Get active in some way.


### Goals for  2016 - "Do" more.
#### Travel more.
#### Consult more.
#### Move more.
#### Relax more.
