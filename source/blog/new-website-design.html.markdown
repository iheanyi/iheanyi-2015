Today I am pleased to announce the launch of the new and improved [iheanyi.com](http://iheanyi.com), which I designed and developed over the last few weeks. Rather than using a CMS such as WordPress, I opted to use [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), an amazing static site builder instead. For handling the grid and styling, I decided to use [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io) and [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.com), mixed in with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io).

####Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops) for the [inspirational hover effects](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/06/19/ideas-for-subtle-hover-effects/), which allowed me to spruce up my project thumbnails.

Additionally, I'd like to thank the countless people who viewed my website as I was developing it and reported any bugs that occurred to me; your quality testing helped make this website better.


Thanks for visiting and reading, I'm looking forward to experiencing and building amazing things in 2015. Please don't hesitate to [contact](/contact.html) me with feedback and comments.
