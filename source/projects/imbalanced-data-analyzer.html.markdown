##### Description
During my final semester of college, I took a course in Data Mining. The professor, [Nitesh Chawla](http://nd.edu/~chawla) is also my Research Advisor and Director at [iCeNSA](http://icensa.com/). For the class, he stated that my group and I could continue my research project, where Professor Chawla wanted a prototype for a *one-stop shop* web framework for automated analyses of large sets of imbalanced data.
